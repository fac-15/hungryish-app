Hungryish is an app to choose your evening plans. Matching movies with recipes.

## Minimum viable standard
1. An app that randomly generates a movie and a recipe
2. Uses tape testing
3. Mobile first design
4. Uses a button click from client to make requests
5. Uses grids
6. TDD

## To Do List
1. Find out how to access big list of movies (done!)
2. Create a button controlled by a click event (done!)
3. Display movie data on landing page when button is clicked

## APIs to Use
1. https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api
2. http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/

## Things we learned
1. CORS (Allow-control-allow-origin)
  --> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi/related?hl=en-US
2. Highlight cmd+D multi-select highlighted text
3. shift arrows tab or shift+tab to indent multiple lines
4. console.dir to show methods on an object/class
5. using debugger in JS to show what's happening step by step

## Stretch goals
1. Additional API
2. Netflix API?
3. Takes user input to help narrow decisions
4. Animated spin
5. Button click on landing page soft-scrolls to either movie or recipe
6. User able to mark a movie as seen
7. Give multiple options of movie/recipe pairs
8. Trailer of movie
9. NOCK - npm to test API
